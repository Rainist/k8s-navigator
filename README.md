# k8s-navigator
[placeholder] A GUI based interactive shell that helps operations in k8s

## Motivations
- After years of using [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/) and [dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard), although they are great tools, I wanted another kind of tool that works more efficiently and still friendly when you need to operate repetitive tasks a lot and often

## Goal
- Provide a robust way to handle operations for k8s cluster 

## WIP
- It's only conceptual now and there is no code yet.
